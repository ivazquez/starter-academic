abstract: Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively
  parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at
  the whole-genome scale. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658
  whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types
  from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the
  International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas
  (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by
  international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes
  contained 4â€“5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic
  elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified,
  suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
  in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic
  event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma,
  for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect
  several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere
  maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
  show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels.
  Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation,
  including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition.
  A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding
  mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter; identifies new
  signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small
  insertions and deletions and structural variation; analyses timings and
  patterns of tumour evolution; describes the diverse transcriptional
  consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes
  and promoter activity; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of
  cancer genomes.
